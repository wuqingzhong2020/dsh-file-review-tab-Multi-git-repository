/**
 * Chat → sidebar deep-link channel.
 *
 * The chat turn-tail row knows which paths (and which turn) the user wants to
 * inspect, but better-sidebar's native right Sidebar mints its own tab ids and
 * does not refresh an already-open tab's `meta` (dsh-better-sidebar #632 /
 * 0.19.1 adapter behaviour). Passing a `path` seed is also unsafe there: the
 * native surface routes path-bearing opens to the file editor, so the review
 * tab would never mount.
 *
 * The channel therefore carries the seed inside this plugin: the chat row
 * publishes it and then opens the tab by type; the tab body subscribes and
 * replays whatever arrived, whether it mounted just now or was already open.
 * Sessions are keyed separately, and each publish gets a monotonic nonce so a
 * replay can never be mistaken for a fresh link.
